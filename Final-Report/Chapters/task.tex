\section{Task formalization}
Sentiment analysis is deployed in different fields %for instance by companies to receive feedbacks through the analysis of forums or reviews.\\
and, with the rise of deep learning, it is possible to deal with very complex scenarios, e.g. when the opinions are not explicitly expressed.\\
In the specific case of this assignment, the goal is to build a machine learning/deep learning model capable of performing subjectivity detection and polarity classification 
comparing the achieved results to a baseline model.\\
More precisely, the aforementioned model needs to perform:
\begin{itemize}
    \item sentiment classification: the automated process of identifying opinions in text and labeling them, based on the emotions expressed within them,
        as positive or negative (since the polarity dataset \textbf{\Cref{subsec:mr}} presents only these two labels); 
    \item subjectivity detection: consists in labeling a text as subjective or objective.
\end{itemize}
