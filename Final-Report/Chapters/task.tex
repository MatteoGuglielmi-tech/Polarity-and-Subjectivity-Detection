\section{Task formalization}
Sentiment analysis is deployed in different fields %for instance by companies to receive feedbacks through the analysis of forums or reviews.\\
and, with the rise of deep learning, it is possible to deal with very complex scenarios, e.g. when the opinions are not explicitly expressed.\\
In the specific case of this assignment, the goal is to build a machine learning/deep learning model capable of performing subjectivity and polarity classification comparing 
the achieved results to a baseline model.\\
More precisely, the aforementioned model needs to perform:
\begin{itemize}
    \item sentiment classification: the automated process of identifying opinions in text and labeling them as positive, negative, or neutral, based on the emotions expressed
        within them. In this specific case, the polarity dataset (\textbf{\Cref{subsec:mr}}) presents only the positive and negative tags reducing the problem to a binary classification task;
    \item subjectivity detection: consists in labeling a text as subjective or objective.
\end{itemize}
