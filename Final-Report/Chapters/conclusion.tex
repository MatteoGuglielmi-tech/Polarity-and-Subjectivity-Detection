\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:end}
To summarise, in this work I've presented an alternative method for performing subjectiviy detection and polarity classification explaining the most salient steps taken to 
carry out this task as well as possible limitations and improvements.\\
As pointed out during the report, the baseline model used for this task is a simple shallow model, which is in most of the cases not the best choice for such complex problems. 
In response to this I also tested a deep learning model able to perform the task with a better accuracy (\textbf{\Cref{subsec:res}}).\\
As final remarks, I would like to point out that the results obtained in this work are not intended as optimal, but they are a good starting point for further improvements. 
In particular, for future improvements I would focus on dealing with the limitation of using the Bert model as encoder trying to use other variants that are not limited to 
a maximum sequence length.
