\begin{abstract}
    This work focuses on explaining the salient steps taken to implement a Sentiment Analysis algorithm that consists in \textit{Subjectivity} and \textit{Polarity Classification}.\\
    More in detail, a custom model is compared to a baseline in order to highlight the improvements achieved. To carry out this project, three different datasets were used : 
    the "\textit{MovieRewievs}" and  "\textit{Subjectivity}" datasets both downloaded from the NLTK python module and the public "\textit{IMDB}" dataset dowloaded from Kaggle\cite{kaggle}.\\
